# upon $thumb invocation, waits 60s for the user to react with a thumbs up
# use this format for checking "maybe" reacts
# use this format for when people react with a role that is not their previously used role
#   possible issue: this is not well suited for long-term waiting; would break if the bot ever turns off. Better to
#   write to a file?
