Steps to add bot to server:

1. In the file "globals.py", populate "guildID" with the server ID, "mainChannelIDs" with the ID of all channels that the bot should listen in, and "adminRole" with the name of a role that will be used to restrict certain commands to trusted users. 

2. Run "reset_db.py" to reset/create the local database files.

3. Click this link to add the bot to any server in which you have "Manage Server" permission. If it says the bot is private, that means I need to temporarily make it public so that other people can use this link.

4. After adding the bot to the server, ensure it has access to all channels specified in step 1, and permissions to send, edit, and delete messages and embed links/files.
