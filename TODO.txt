- CHANGE:   move the user-defined global variables into a different file (config.json)
            then populate those user-defined global vars in on_ready()

- IMPLEMENT: if the length of the event embed would become larger than 6000 chars, do not add a name to the fields
             (should still be able to remove)

- IMPLEMENT: make all choices in "profession_interaction.py" source from config file (profession_config.json)

- IMPLEMENT: make the globals.py config check if OS is RPI or WINDOWS, and change stuff accordingly
    - or just make a global var representing if OS is RPI or WINDOWS? then I only import "platform" once...

- CHANGE:   db.info_embed should use db global values for entry indices, same for helpers.parse_entry

- CHANGE:   entry should be a defined datatype with a specific format. Should pass around complete entries, not partial
            --> see db.info_embed, profession_interaction.py first entry section. Messy! prone to breaking.
            - Make a class for it. The constructor should populate it with default values

- CHECK: I added a new line "logging.error(traceback.format_exc())" to error_handler.py on the RPI
    - Hopefully it logs the exceptions now.
    - Got some of these:
2023/01/25 06:57:20 (UTC-0800) - [ERROR] [base_events.default_exception_handler:1738]: Task exception was never retrieved
2023/01/25 06:57:30 (UTC-0800) - [ERROR] [base_events.default_exception_handler:1738]: Task exception was never retrieved

2023/01/25 06:57:37 (UTC-0800) - [ERROR] [base_events.default_exception_handler:1738]: Task exception was never retrieved
2023/01/25 06:57:37 (UTC-0800) - [ERROR] [base_events.default_exception_handler:1738]: Task exception was never retrieved
2023/01/25 06:57:58 (UTC-0800) - [ERROR] [base_events.default_exception_handler:1738]: Task exception was never retrieved

    - But there is no logging of what caused them. Hopefully this helps me diagnose.


UNTESTED CHANGES:
    - confirm maybe loop
    - confirm maybe loop restarts on bot startup if event is active
    - confirm maybe loop should cancel when event is closed


NOTES from 2/26/2023:
    - Added a lot of stuff for json support in profession_interaction.py
    - (PRIORITY): I want to stop converting levels/units to chars/ints in the database. just keep them as strings.
        --> Then, I can just write "long_to_short_form" dictionary in profession_info.json
            - It will apply to units & mm_traps for CSV display (and maybe march size?)
    - Then I can replace db.profession_dicts() with pulling from profession_info.json

    - For helpers.py, I can sort things by using a sorted lambda from the json options index
    e.g. sorted_levels = sorted(levels, lambda x: json_levels.index(x))

    - I will keep db entries in long-form until writing to CSV. Makes it easier.

    - Done with everything for the transition EXCEPT helpers.py sorting functions. Sort by index as written above.
