- IMPLEMENT: edit_event()   # I have no idea what functionality this should have

- ISSUE: $help does not work in private channel
    ->  await destination.send(page)
    AttributeError: 'Object' object has no attribute 'send'
    where destination should be the ctx of $help

    (but sometimes it does! like right now)

- CHANGE:   move the user-defined global variables into a different file (config.txt)
            then populate those user-defined global vars in on_ready()

- CHANGE: let $create_event specify what time the event will be at, and also the title of the event
          Might have to consider timezones here.

- IMPLEMENT: get a profile pic for the bot

- CHANGE:   DEPRECATED FOR NOW (was not received well)
            - When the fields become long, the buttons will be far below the event message.
            - soln: make the buttons be above the event message
            - blankMsg = await ctx.send('')
            - eventMsg = await ctx.send(embed=eventEmbed)
            - view = EventButtons(eventMsg)
            - await blankMsg.edit(view=view)

- CHANGE:   the CSV can probably be formatted a little more conveniently. Leave out duplicate info like class, unit
            within certain categories? since they are always the same.

---------PRIORITY--------------

- IMPLEMENT:    $bug DM command for reporting issues or bugs. Bot will log $bug in bugreports.log

- CHANGE:    a field can hold a maximum of 2048 characters. Average of ~10chars per user -> maximum of 200 people
            - current soln: just don't add names if it'd go over 2048 chars (not great, expect 200-250 people)
            - better soln: create 3 YES fields in bottom row, populate them one-by-one. maximum of ~600 people
                MAYBE, WHITESPACE, NO fields in top row

            - actually, a field can only hold 1024 characters... If don't want to do the 3 yes fields, can just do a
            "..." at the bottom of the field. 3 yes fields will hold roughly 300 people

- IMPLEMENT: custom help command https://gist.github.com/InterStella0/b78488fb28cadf279dfd3164b9f0cf96
             (and make it send to DM)

- IMPLEMENT: _build_csv() should put a lock on updating the database, and any writes that go out should be rejected
             with a response to their context indicating that the write failed
             - I think opening a file is blocking, so this is already accomplished?

- IMPLEMENT: confirm_maybe()
    https://github.com/gawel/aiocron    use aiocron to check on the MAYBE's X hrs before event Start

- CHANGE: no longer building teams with logic. Instead just produce filtered lists (f.x. CE-A, CE-N, CE-F)

- IMPLEMENT: https://codezup.com/python-program-reader-writer-problem-mutex/
    implement thread-queueing for sql writes (way better than current "buffer" solution lmao)
    https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html or perhaps this is a solution?
    https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-eventloop.html#asyncio.loop.run_in_executor or maybe this?
    *** https://pypi.org/project/aiosqlite/     aiosqlite?
        "aiosqlite allows interaction with SQLite databases on the main AsyncIO event loop without blocking execution of
         other coroutines while waiting for queries or data fetches. It does this by using a single, shared thread per
         connection. This thread executes all actions within a shared request queue to prevent overlapping actions."

    https://github.com/Rapptz/asqlite
        Rapptz version of aiosqlite, so I'll use it bc it's rapptz

- CHANGE:   change error messages to embeds?

- TEST:     if two people press an EventButton at the same time, can it break the field due to async read-write of the
            field value? I think so. get ian to test.
