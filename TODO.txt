- CHANGE:   move the user-defined global variables into a different file (config.json)
            then populate those user-defined global vars in on_ready()

- IMPLEMENT: if the length of the event embed would become larger than 6000 chars, do not add a name to the fields
             (should still be able to remove)

- IMPLEMENT: make all choices in "profession_interaction.py" source from config file (profession_config.json)
    - Update levels, march sizes per avobot_todo.txt
    - helpers.py will need to reference this document for CSV sorting
    - Rename db.profession_dicts() to db.database_to_text_dicts(), and introduce db.text_to_database_dicts() for
        translating between db storage and human storage

- IMPLEMENT: make the globals.py config check if OS is RPI or WINDOWS, and change stuff accordingly
    - or just make a global var representing if OS is RPI or WINDOWS? then I only import "platform" once...

- IMPLEMENT: db.get_default_entry(user_id, profession_info)
    - move the logic for creating a new entry into db, instead of hard-coding it in profession_interaction.py

- CHECK: I added a new line "logging.error(traceback.format_exc())" to error_handler.py on the RPI
    - Hopefully it logs the exceptions now.
    - Got some of these:
2023/01/25 06:57:20 (UTC-0800) - [ERROR] [base_events.default_exception_handler:1738]: Task exception was never retrieved
2023/01/25 06:57:30 (UTC-0800) - [ERROR] [base_events.default_exception_handler:1738]: Task exception was never retrieved

2023/01/25 06:57:58 (UTC-0800) - [ERROR] [base_events.default_exception_handler:1738]: Task exception was never retrieved

    - But there is no logging of what caused them. Hopefully this helps me diagnose.


UNTESTED CHANGES:
    - confirm maybe loop
    - confirm maybe loop restarts on bot startup if event is active
    - confirm maybe loop should cancel when event is closed
