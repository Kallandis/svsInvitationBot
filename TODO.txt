- NOTE: if commands are called by people in another timezone, the event time will be constructed on the local machine
        and timezone info will be assumed to be that of the local machine.

        So, all times given to the bot will be assumed to be in PST. Not sure how to deal with this other than getting
        people to put in times as unix times. But it's not a big deal

- CHANGE:   move the user-defined global variables into a different file (config.txt)
            then populate those user-defined global vars in on_ready()

- CHANGE:   CSV formatting changes - depends on what the organizers want
            - remove certain redundant cols to make it more compact. F.X., when entries are grouped by unit and class,
                don't need to include the unit and class in that entry.

            - display march size as median instead of range?
                - if doing this, it would be best to just store it as that in the DB. Could still write the range
                  in db.info_embed() for user convenience.

- IDEA:     do I have to consider memory "leaks"? examples:
                - should I be explicitly deleting old instances of EventButtons() once the event closes?
                - should I be explicitly deleting instances of ProfessionMenuView()?

- IMPLEMENT: if the length of the event embed would become larger than 6000 chars, do not add a name to the fields
             (should still be able to remove)

- CATCHUP (changes made on the pi):
                - in helpers.delete_event(), refetch the event message by stored ID and check if it exists; if not,
                wipe everything as if delete_event was successful. This is to deal with when they manually delete the
                event message
                    - NOTE: on the pi, I just check the eventMessage. This only works if the bot has been restarted
                    after the event message was manually deleted. Above method is better
                - Added new channel "el-registration" in globals.py: 951396183610388491

- IMPLEMENT:    move several admin-specific commands to ADMIN cog?
- IMPLEMENT:    strip commas from names in all_of_category
- IMPLEMENT:    kill off global event variables.
                Very easy to do except for db.info_embed(), which is far away from any bot instance. But it can be done.
                Probably easiest to just pass the bot along the chain until it hits info_embed()?

- IMPLEMENT:    add a fxn to manually edit someone else's entry by ID
- IMPLEMENT:    make logger include ID/display name of people when there is an error, when possible

- ISSUE:    getting a lot of RuntimeError's due to process_click(). Likely due to asyncio.Lock() trying to create its own
            event loop. Needs to be made in the same stack as the original function call? in which case, it needs to
            be either a global or a parameter of the bot object. Test with global for convenience.

            - can try to do something like asyncio.Lock(loop=asyncio.get_running_event_loop())

            - Or alternatively, trying to copy from https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53724665/using-queues-results-in-asyncio-exception-got-future-future-pending-attached?rq=1

                async def main():
                    button_lock = asyncio.Lock()
                    bot.button_lock = button_lock
                    async with bot:
                        await bot.start(tokenFile.token)

- ISSUE:    got a crash from weird infinite heartbeat bug (probably related to runtime error?), see screenshot


- TEST:     need to test get_raw_csv(). also, just make it an optional argument of get_csv()
