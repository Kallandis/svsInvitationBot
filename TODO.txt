- NOTE: if commands are called by people in another timezone, the event time will be constructed on the local machine
        and timezone info will be assumed to be that of the local machine.

        So, all times given to the bot will be assumed to be in PST. Not sure how to deal with this other than getting
        people to put in times as unix times. But it's not a big deal

- CHANGE:   move the user-defined global variables into a different file (config.txt)
            then populate those user-defined global vars in on_ready()

- CHANGE:   CSV formatting changes - depends on what the organizers want
            - remove certain redundant cols to make it more compact. F.X., when entries are grouped by unit and class,
                don't need to include the unit and class in that entry.

            - display march size as median instead of range?
                - if doing this, it would be best to just store it as that in the DB. Could still write the range
                  in db.info_embed() for user convenience.

- IDEA:     do I have to consider memory "leaks"? examples:
                - should I be explicitly deleting old instances of EventButtons() once the event closes?
                - should I be explicitly deleting instances of ProfessionMenuView()?

- IMPLEMENT: if the length of the event embed would become larger than 6000 chars, do not add a name to the fields
             (should still be able to remove)

---------PRIORITY--------------

- IMPLEMENT:    kill off global event variables.
                Very easy to do except for db.info_embed(), which is far away from any bot instance. But it can be done.
                Probably easiest to just pass the bot along the chain until it hits info_embed()?

CHANGELIST FROM LAST TEST:
    - delete successful as well as unsuccessful commands in guild channels
    - add some text to the event embed telling people to check their DM if it's their first response
    - bot has activity text "Playing ~help" to show the command prefix and the help command
    - Put longer prompts in the message above the ""~info change" select menus
    UNTESTED:
        - confirm maybe loop restarts when bot restarts
        - confirm maybe loop closes when event is closed



UNTESTED CHANGES:
    - confirm maybe loop
    - confirm maybe loop restarts on bot startup if event is active
    - confirm maybe loop should cancel when event is closed
